### Features
The STM32F4DISCOVERY offers the following features:

- **STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller** featuring:
  - 32-bit ARM Cortex®-M4 with FPU core
  - 1-Mbyte Flash memory
  - 192-Kbyte RAM
  - LQFP100 package

- **On-board ST-LINK/V2** (on STM32F4DISCOVERY) or **ST-LINK/V2-A** (on STM32F407G-DISC1)

- **ARM® mbed™-enabled** ([http://mbed.org](http://mbed.org)) with ST-LINK/V2-A only

- **USB ST-LINK** with re-enumeration capability and three different interfaces:
  - Virtual COM port (with ST-LINK/V2-A only)
  - Mass storage (with ST-LINK/V2-A only)
  - Debug port

- **Board power supply**:
  - Through USB bus
  - External power sources: 3 V and 5 V

- **Sensors**:
  - LIS302DL or LIS3DSH ST MEMS 3-axis accelerometer
  - MP45DT02 ST MEMS audio sensor (omnidirectional digital microphone)
  - CS43L22 audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver

- **Eight LEDs**:
  - **LD1** (red/green) for USB communication
  - **LD2** (red) for 3.3 V power on
  - Four user LEDs: **LD3** (orange), **LD4** (green), **LD5** (red), and **LD6** (blue)
  - Two USB OTG LEDs: **LD7** (green) VBUS and **LD8** (red) over-current

- **Two pushbuttons** (user and reset)

- **USB OTG FS** with micro-AB connector

- **Extension header** for all LQFP100 I/Os for quick connection to prototyping board and easy development
