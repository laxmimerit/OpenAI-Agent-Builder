## The Internet of Things (IoT)

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** is the network of physical objects embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with the manufacturer, operator, and/or other connected devices. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet Infrastructure.

Typically, IoT is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications (M2M) and covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications.

Things, in the IoT, can refer to a wide variety of devices such as:

- Heart monitoring implants  
- Biochip transponders on farm animals  
- Electric clams in coastal waters  
- Automobiles with built-in sensors  
- Field operation devices that assist firefighters in search and rescue
