British processor powerhouse **ARM Holdings** launched a new, low-power operating system designed to manage web-connected devices and appliances using chips based on the company’s 32-bit Cortex-M microcontrollers.  

### ARM Processor Got New OS: mbed  

The operating system, called **mbed OS**, aims to resolve productivity challenges caused by fragmentation in the "Internet of Things" (IoT) market. ARM seeks to consolidate devices under a single software layer that is **simple, secure, and free** for all manufacturers to use.
