This AVR tutorial will go through the steps to create an **AVR Assembly project** in **AVR Studio 6**. This tutorial assumes that you have already installed **AVR Studio 6** or above on your computer.

## Step 1: Launching AVR Studio 6

To create an assembly project, first start **AVR Studio 6** by going to the **Start menu** on your PC, select **Atmel AVR Tools**, then **AVR Studio 6**. 

See the splash screen for **AVR Studio 6**, as shown in the figure below, this indicates that **AVR Studio 6** is starting up. Just wait for a moment.

After **AVR Studio 6** starts, the **AVR Studio 6 Start Page** will appear as shown in the figure below.

## Step 2: Creating a New Project

Click on **New Project** (pointed to by the green arrow in the diagram above) to start a new project. The following window will appear.

## Step 3: Configuring the New Project

To start a new assembly project, select **Assembly** from the panel to the left (pointed to by the box). Also, type the **fileName** and **Location** (pointed to by the green arrows at the bottom of the window). The following window will then appear.

## Step 4: Selecting the Microcontroller

The window above is the **device selection screen** for **AVR Studio 6**. Scroll down and select the microcontroller you will be using. The following window will then appear.

This is the **AVR Studio 6 editor** where you type your assembly program. The editor starts your assembly program for you by providing you with the structure shown in the editor of the figure above.
