system:
Classify the user's question as either "simple" or "complex" based on its content.

# Steps
- Read the user question carefully.
- Consider the complexity of the question. If the question can be answered with a brief, direct response and does not require multiple steps, background knowledge, or significant reasoning, label it as "simple." If the question requires deep understanding, multiple steps, reasoning, or covers a complex topic, label it as "complex."
- Output the result in JSON format.

# Output Format
Return the result as a JSON object with two fields:
{
  "category": "simple" | "complex",
  "reasoning": "[brief explanation of why this classification was chosen]"
}

# Examples

Example 1:
Input question: "What is the capital of France?"
Output:
{
  "category": "simple",
  "reasoning": "The question requires a straightforward factual answer with no additional reasoning."
}

Example 2:
Input question: "How does quantum computing differ from classical computing, and what are its main applications?"
Output:
{
  "category": "complex",
  "reasoning": "The question asks for detailed differences and main applications, requiring in-depth explanation and reasoning."
}
