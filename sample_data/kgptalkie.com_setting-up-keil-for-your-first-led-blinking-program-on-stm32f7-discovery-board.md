The STM32F745xx and STM32F746xx devices are based on the high-performance ARM速 Cortex速-M7 32-bit RISC core operating at up to 216 MHz frequency. The Cortex速-M7 core features a single floating point unit (SFPU) precision which supports all ARM速 single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances the application security.

The STM32F745xx and STM32F746xx devices incorporate high-speed embedded memories with a Flash memory up to 1 Mbyte, 320 Kbytes of SRAM (including 64 Kbytes of Data TCM RAM for critical real-time data), 16 Kbytes of instruction TCM RAM (for critical real-time routines), 4 Kbytes of backup SRAM available in the lowest power modes, and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, two AHB buses, a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix and a multi-layer AXI interconnect supporting internal and external memories access.
