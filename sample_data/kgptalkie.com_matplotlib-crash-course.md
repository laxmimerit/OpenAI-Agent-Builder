## Introduction

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays. It can be used in Python and IPython shells, Jupyter notebook and web application servers also. Matplotlib is written in Python and makes use of NumPy, the numerical mathematics extension of Python.

Here we have imported the necessary libraries.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from numpy.random import randint
%matplotlib inline
```

## Plot

`linspace()` returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval. We will generate 20 evenly spaced numbers between 1 and 10.

```python
x = np.linspace(1, 10, 20)
x
```

Output:
```
array([ 1.        ,  1.47368421,  1.94736842,  2.42105263,  2.89473684,
        3.36842105,  3.84210526,  4.31578947,  4.78947368,  5.26315789,
        5.73684211,  6.21052632,  6.68421053,  7.15789474,  7.63157895,
        8.10526316,  8.57894737,  9.05263158,  9.52631579, 10.        ])
```

The `randint()` method returns an integer number selected from the specified range. Here we are generating 20 random integers between 1 and 50.

```python
y = randint(1, 50, 20)
y
```

Output:
```
array([43, 13, 39, 35, 14, 31, 36, 17, 27, 36, 15, 47, 12, 36,  6, 20, 19,
       17, 29, 36])
```

We can check the `size` of `y` as shown below.

```python
y.size
```

Output:
```
20
```

You can get a list of all the functions which can be used on `plt` by running the command `dir(plt)`.

```python
dir(plt)[:10]
```

Output:
```
['Annotation',
 'Arrow',
 'Artist',
 'AutoLocator',
 'Axes',
 'Button',
 'Circle',
 'Figure',
 'FigureCanvasBase',
 'FixedFormatter']
```

Now we will draw a plot for `y` using `plt.plot()`.

```python
plt.plot(y)
```

Now we will arrange the values in `y` ascending order using `sort()`.

```python
y = np.sort(y)
print(y)
```

Output:
```
[ 6 12 13 14 15 17 17 19 20 27 29 31 35 36 36 36 36 39 43 47]
plt.plot(y)
```

### Label

Till now we have only passed one parameter `y` to `plot()`. Hence the values on the x axis are not in our control. Now we will pass two parameters `x` and `y` to `plot()`. We have set the colour to green by passing `color = 'g'`. We can name the x and y axis by using `xlabel()` and `ylabel()`. We can even give a title to our plot using `title()`.

```python
plt.plot(x, y, color = 'g')
plt.xlabel('X Axis')
plt.ylabel('Y Axis')
plt.title('Random Plot')
plt.show()
```

## Scatter, Bar, Hist, and Box Plots

A scatter plot is a diagram where each value in the data set is represented by a dot. We can use `scatter()` to plot a scatter plot.

```python
plt.scatter(x, y)
```

Now we will see how to plot a bar plot. For that first we will create the data `a` and `b`. Then we will draw the bar plot using `bar()`.

```python
b = [10, 20, 3, 4, 5]
a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
plt.bar(a, b)
```

`sample()` is an inbuilt function of random module in Python that returns a particular length list of items chosen from the sequence i.e. list, tuple, string or set. Here we are going to sample 10 integers from 1 to 10000.

```python
from random import sample
data = sample(range(1, 10000), 10)
data
```

Output:
```
[5768, 405, 2213, 7584, 5100, 1136, 7028, 1777, 3683, 4265]
```

Now we will draw a histogram for `data` using `hist()`. `rwidth` is used to set the relative width of the bars as a fraction of the bin width.

```python
plt.hist(data, rwidth=0.8)
```

Now we will plot a box plot. Box plots show the five-number summary of a set of data: including the minimum, first (lower) quartile, median, third (upper) quartile, and maximum. Box plots divide the data into sections that each contain approximately 25% of the data in that set. The first quartile is the 25th percentile. Second quartile is 50th percentile and third quartile is 75th percentile.

We will start by generating data. `normal` is used to draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution. It will draw 100 samples with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 and 2. We will use `boxplot()`.

```python
vert = True
makes the boxes vertical. As patch_artist= True the boxes will be drawn using patch artists. A patch is a 2D artist with a face color and an edge color.
data = [np.random.normal(0, std, 100)
for std in range(1,3)]
plt.boxplot(data, vert = True, patch_artist=True)
plt.show()
```

## Subplot

Now we will see how to draw 2 plots together. For this we will use `subplot()`. It adds a subplot to the current figure. The first 2 parameters represent the number of rows and columns and the third parameter represents the index. Here we have one row and 2 columns. At the first index i.e at the first row and first column we are drawing `x` vs `y` plot. At the second index i.e. at the first row and second column we are drawing `x` vs `x*y` plot. We can use `markersize` to adjust the width of the point markers. `b*` represents blue stars.

```python
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(x, y, 'ro', markersize = 5)

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
y2 = y*x
plt.plot(x, y2, 'b*')
```

Now we will see the object oriented way to draw plots. We will first create a object and then call different methods on that object. Here we have created objects using `plt.subplots()` and then we are calling the method `plot()` on the object to get the line plot.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y, markersize = 12, linewidth = 3, color = '#005425')
```

Now we will create a `fig` object using `plt.figure()`. Then we will add axes on the object using `fig.add_axes()` It add an axes at position rect [left, bottom, width, height]. Now we will draw two plots. We will plot `x` vs `y` on `ax1` and `x` vs `y2` i.e. `x*y` on `ax2`.

```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1])
ax2 = fig.add_axes([0.1, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3])


ax1.plot(x, y, 'r')
ax1.set_xlabel('X')
ax1.set_ylabel('Y')
ax1.set_title('Y Plot')

ax2.plot(x, y2, 'g')
ax2.set_xlabel('X')
ax2.set_ylabel('Y')
ax2.set_title('Y2 Plot')
```

Here we have created objects `fig` and `ax`. We will create 2 subplots using `subplots(1,2)` i.e. we will have one row and 2 columns. `ax[0]` gives us the first position i.e. first row and first column. `ax[1]` gives us the second position i.e. first row and second column.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2)

ax[0].plot(x, y, 'b')

ax[1].plot(x, y, 'r')
```

Now we will use a `for` loop which is more efficient way to do the same thing. In the first iteration of the loop `x` vs `y` plot is drawn using red colour in the first position. In the second loop `x` vs `y2` plot is drawn using green colour in the second position. `tight_layout()` will adjust spacing between subplots to minimize the overlaps.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2)
col = ['r', 'g']
data = [y, y2]
for i, axes in enumerate(ax):
    axes.plot(x, data[i], col[i])

fig.tight_layout()
```

We can change the figure size using `figsize`. We can even control the resolution in dots per inch using `dpi`. Here we have plotted 2 lines having same x axis in the same plot. A legend is an area describing the elements of the graph. In the matplotlib library, thereâ€™s a function called `legend()` which is used to Place a legend on the axes. The attribute `loc` in `legend()` is used to specify the location of the legend. Finally, we can save the current figure using `savefig()` method on the `fig` object.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (8,4), dpi = 100)

**Source:** https://kgptalkie.com/matplotlib-crash-course

ax.plot(x, y, 'r', label = 'y')
ax.plot(x, y2, 'b', label = 'y*x')
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')
ax.set_title('Random Number Plot')
ax.legend(loc = 0)
fig.savefig('random file.png', dpi = 100)
```

## xlim, ylim, xticks, and yticks

As you can see we have got 2 plots in a single axes by passing two pairs of x and y values. We are limiting the x and y axis values using `set_xlim()` and `set_ylim()` respectively. The first subplot and the third subplot have the same values but different x and y limits. We can say that the third subplot is the zoomed version of the first subplot.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize = (12, 4))

ax[0].plot(x, y, x, y2)

ax[1].plot(x, y**2, 'k')
ax[1].set_ylim([0, 500])

**Source:** https://kgptalkie.com/matplotlib-crash-course

ax[2].plot(x, y, x, y2)
ax[2].set_ylim([0, 100])
ax[2].set_xlim([1 ,4])
```

Now we will see how to change the scale type. We can change the scale of y axis by using `set_yscale()`. We have set the y scale type to `log` which is the logarithmic scale. The `exp()` function in Python allows users to calculate the exponential value with the base set to e.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize= (10, 4))
ax[0].plot(x, y, x, y2)

ax[1].plot(x, np.exp(x))
ax[1].set_yscale('log')
fig.tight_layout()
```

Now we will see how to format the ticks. Ticks are the values used to show specific points on the coordinate axis. `set_xticks()` is used to set the current tick locations on the x axis. `set_xticklabels()` is used to set the current tick labels of the x-axis.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,5))
ax.plot(x, y2)
ax.set_xticks([1 , 3, 5, 10])
ax.set_xticklabels([r'a', r'b', r'$\gamma$', r'$\delta$'], fontsize=18)

ax.set_yticks([0, 100, 500])
```

Here we are importing the `ticker` module. This module contains classes for configuring tick locating and formatting. `ScalarFormatter` is a default formatter for scalars. It formats tick values as a number. As `useMathText=True` it will show the offset in a latex-like (MathText) format as x10^2. `set_scientific()` is used to turn scientific notation on or off. Here scientific notation is on. `set_powerlimits()` is used to set size thresholds for scientific notation.

```python
from matplotlib import ticker
formatter = ticker.ScalarFormatter(useMathText=True)
formatter.set_scientific(True)
formatter.set_powerlimits((-1, 2))
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)
```
