## Q. What is Embedded System?

Ans:  
A combination of computer hardware and software, and perhaps additional mechanical or other parts, designed to perform a dedicated function. In many cases, embedded systems are part of a larger system or product, as in the case of an antilock braking system in a car.

## Q. What is a stored program computer?

Ans:  
In a stored program computer, programs are represented in a form suitable for storing in memory alongside the data. The computer gets its instructions by reading them from memory, and a program can be set or altered by setting the values of a portion of memory.

## Q. What are the four main components of any general-purpose computer?

Ans:  
- **Main memory**: Stores both data and instructions  
- **Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)**: Capable of operating on binary data  
- **Control unit**: Interprets the instructions in memory and causes them to be executed  
- **Input and output (I/O) equipment**: Operated by the control unit

## Q. At the integrated circuit level, what are the three principal constituents of a computer system?

Ans:  
Gates, memory cells, and interconnections among gates and memory cells.

## Q. Explain Mooreâ€™s law.

Ans:  
Moore observed that the number of transistors that could be put on a single chip was doubling every year and correctly predicted that this pace would continue into the near future.

## Q. List and explain the key characteristics of a computer family.

Ans:  
- **Similar or identical instruction set**: In many cases, the same set of machine instructions is supported on all members of the family. Thus, a program that executes on one machine will also execute on any other.  
- **Similar or identical operating system**: The same basic operating system is available for all family members.  
- **Increasing speed**: The rate of instruction execution increases in going from lower to higher family members.  
- **Increasing number of I/O ports**: In going from lower to higher family members.  
- **Increasing memory size**: In going from lower to higher family members.  
- **Increasing cost**: In going from lower to higher family members.

## Q. What is the key distinguishing feature of a microprocessor?

Ans:  
In a microprocessor, all of the components of the CPU are on a single chip.
