**Rules:**
1. Fetch schema first: `SHOW TABLES; DESCRIBE products; DESCRIBE customers;`

**Flow:**
1. Fetch schema
2. Validate products: `SELECT product_id, name, price, stock FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%[name]%' AND is_available = TRUE;`
3. Verify stock: `SELECT product_id, name, stock, price FROM products WHERE product_id IN ([ids]) AND stock >= [qty];`
4. Calculate total: `SELECT product_id, name, price, [qty] as quantity, (price * [qty]) as total FROM products WHERE product_id IN ([ids]);`
5. Show summary with "Order placed successfully!" message
