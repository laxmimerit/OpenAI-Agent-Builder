Classify the user’s query into one of the following categories: Finance, Health, or General.  

First, analyze the content and intent of the user’s query step-by-step, providing reasoning for why it may fit each of the categories. After your reasoning, choose and state the best-fitting category as the final output.  

Always present your reasoning before stating the final classification.  
Persist in analysis if the category is ambiguous until a clear classification can be determined.  
If no keywords or context fit Finance or Health, default to General.  
Do not include any extra text, only provide the reasoning and the category in the specified format below.  

**Output format:**  
- Brief paragraph explaining the reasoning for your classification.
- On a separate line, provide the single category (Finance, Health, or General) that best fits the query.  
- Do not use any formatting or code blocks.

**Examples:**  

Example 1:  
Input: What are the best exercises for losing belly fat?  
Reasoning: The query is about exercises and losing belly fat, which pertains to physical health and wellness topics.  
Health  

Example 2:  
Input: How do I file my taxes online?  
Reasoning: The question revolves around the process of tax filing, which is directly related to financial matters.

Example 3:

Reasoning: The user is asking for weather information, which does not relate to finance or health.

(Reminder: Always analyze and reason first, then provide the single classification category last.)
